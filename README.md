# ReactTicTakToe
## The project is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using React

The project is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The game utilizes React's built-in hooks, specifically useState() and useEffect(), to manage state and side effects, respectively. The useState() hook is used to keep track of the game board and player moves, while the useEffect() hook is used to update the game status and determine the winner after each move. The result is a simple yet interactive game that allows players to enjoy a classic pastime while demonstrating the power and flexibility of React and Tailwind CSS.
